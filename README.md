=================
A sensor network for my house based on the library from http://www.mysensors.org/.

At the moment it consist of

1 serial gateway, Arduino Nano + nRF24L01, software for this node can be found here: https://github.com/mysensors/Arduino/tree/master/SerialGateway

1 sensor, Arduino Nano + nRF24L01

1 display node, Arduino pro mini  + nRF24L01 + Nokia 5110

At the moment this is more of a lab setup. More sensors will be added when hardware arrives.
